# 3D_Rendering-_in_Python
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to visualize 3D models using VTK (Visualization Toolkit) and perform geometric analysis using Trimesh library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- VTK (pip install vtk)
- Trimesh (pip install trimesh)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip: 
   pip install vtk trimesh

3. Modify the `file_paths` list in the `main()` function of the script (`vtk_trimesh_visualization.py`) to specify the paths to your OBJ files.

4. Run the script:
   python main.py

5. The script will display the 3D models using VTK and calculate their dimensions and volume using Trimesh. You can also change the color of the models by pressing the corresponding keys.

## File Structure

- `vtk_trimesh_visualization.py`: Python script containing the main functionality.
- `object.obj`: Sample OBJ file used for visualization and analysis.

## Additional Notes

- This script is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for further development. Feel free to customize it according to your requirements.
- Make sure to replace the sample OBJ file (`object.obj`) with your own 3D models for visualization and analysis.
